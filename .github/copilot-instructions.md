Copilot should propose small refactorings and autocomplete code. Defer to Claude and Codex for major design choices.

## Copilot Responsibilities

- **Code Completion**: Intelligent autocomplete for methods, variables, and patterns
- **Inline Suggestions**: Quick fixes and improvements during coding
- **Pattern Recognition**: Suggest consistent coding patterns and idioms
- **Refactoring**: Small-scale improvements and optimizations
- **Documentation**: Generate JSDoc comments and inline documentation

## Collaboration Guidelines

- **With Claude**: Implement architectural decisions and design patterns
- **With Codex**: Optimize implementations and suggest performance improvements
- **Handoff Signals**: Look for `@copilot` comments for specific optimization requests

## Best Practices

- Maintain consistency with existing code style
- Suggest secure coding practices
- Propose performance optimizations
- Recommend modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
- Ensure accessibility in UI components
